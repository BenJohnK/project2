1.Definition and Usage
	The <!DOCTYPE> declaration must be the very first thing in your HTML document, before the <html> tag.

	The <!DOCTYPE> declaration is not an HTML tag; it is an instruction to the web browser about what version of HTML the page is written in.

	In HTML 4.01, the <!DOCTYPE> declaration refers to a DTD, because HTML 4.01 was based on SGML. The DTD specifies the rules for the 	markup language, so that the browsers render the content correctly.

	HTML5 is not based on SGML, and therefore does not require a reference to a DTD.

	Tip: Always add the <!DOCTYPE> declaration to your HTML documents, so that the browser knows what type of document to expect.

2.The DOCTYPE declaration defines the document type to be HTML
The text between <html> and </html> describes an HTML document
The text between <head> and </head> provides information about the document
The text between <title> and </title> provides a title for the document
The text between <body> and </body> describes the visible page content
The text between <h1> and </h1> describes a heading
The text between <p> and </p> describes a paragraph


3.Definition and Usage

The value attribute specifies the value of an <input> element.

The value attribute is used differently for different input types:

For "button", "reset", and "submit" - it defines the text on the button
For "text", "password", and "hidden" - it defines the initial (default) value of the input field
For "checkbox", "radio", "image" - it defines the value associated with the input (this is also the value that is sent on submit)
Note: The value attribute is required with <input type="checkbox"> and <input type="radio">.

Note: The value attribute cannot be used with <input type="file">.
